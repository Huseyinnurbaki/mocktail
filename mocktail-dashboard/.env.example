# Optional: Override the Mocktail URL displayed in the dashboard
# This changes what users see and copy (e.g., in Create tab, Copy button)
# Useful when deploying behind a reverse proxy or custom domain
#
# Examples:
# REACT_APP_MOCKTAIL_URL=https://api.mycompany.com/mocktail
# REACT_APP_MOCKTAIL_URL=https://mocktail.example.com/mocktail
#
# If not set, defaults to:
# - Development: http://localhost:4000/mocktail
# - Production: [your-domain]/mocktail
#
# REACT_APP_MOCKTAIL_URL=
